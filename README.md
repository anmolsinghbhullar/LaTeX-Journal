# LaTeX Journal 

A journal written entirely in LaTeX. Effectively a fork of SingularisArt's [LaTeX](https://github.com/SingularisArt/LaTeX) but I removed things as I saw fit since I really only care about the journal part. Over time I may add more things to fit in my notes for CS/Math. 

Not _officially_ a port since this project initially started looking very different until I came across their project.

### Installation

This comes with a `Makefile` so download the repo (or execute `git clone https://github.com/anmolsinghbhullar/LaTeX-Journal` in a shell with git CLI) and then execute `make view`.

You can also just compile `main.tex` in a LaTeX IDE of your choice.

### Built With

- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - Sorry for _that_ person. 
- [AUCTeX](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/) - An extensible package for writing and formatting TeX files in Emacs.
- [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/mainpage2023.html) - Port of TeX Live to Macintosh.

### Other remarks

I tried to add comments with the more complex parts. So if you have any questions, let me know.

In order to make start the journal at the date of your choice, edit `main.tex` and replace the date on line 12 with the one of your choice.

Not actually going to be updating this with my journal, this is just a template.
